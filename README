README for Crypt::Password
==========================

This is just a wrapper for perl's crypt(), which can do everything you would
probably want to do to store a password, but this is supposed to provide the
various uses easier.

Installing
----------
The application is designed to be installed like a CPAN module; so use
the usual:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  sudo make install

The CPAN module dependencies will be highlighted during the first
command. If you do not have 'sudo' installed, you can use:

  su root -c make install
